This is a personal project to find posts on Reddit that are from people seeking advice on finding a meaningful career.

I save posts for my future self to look at, then I hide the posts to filter them out of future results.
I also upvote posts if I was able to answer in a helpful way so that later I will be able to find out which search
queries are most effective (the ones that turn up the most upvoted submissions will be most effective).

In order to set up the bot for your account you can follow instructions [here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps).

To use this project, install `python3` in your [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html),
and if you want email to work then install `yagmail` with `pip3 install yagmail` (maybe have to run `brew install pip3`).
Then follow [yagmail README](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail) to provide your Gmail password to your keychain so
the code can use it.

This code isn't really designed so that other people can use it, but you're welcome to clone it and modify your copy
if it helps you.
