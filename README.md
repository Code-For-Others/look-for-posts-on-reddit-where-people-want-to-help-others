This is a personal project to find posts on Reddit that are from people seeking advice on finding a meaningful career.

To use this project, install `python3` in your [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html),
and install `yagmail` with `pip3 install yagmail` (maybe have to run `brew install pip3`).
Then follow [yagmail README](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail) to provide your Gmail password to your keychain so
the code can use it.

This code isn't really designed so that other people can use it, but you're welcome to clone it and modify your copy
if it helps you.
